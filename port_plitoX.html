        </div>

        <div class="col-md-9">
            <p>Welcome to the "PlitoX" project, where I embarked on a mission to revamp the front end of our client's
                website.
                Starting with a design concept crafted in Figma (see <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/YxddxrxXuAypOAwYLNBQ61/PlitoX-version-2?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=nRX3ipjoXCktxsLR-1">Figma design
                file</a>). The next step involved customizing an HTML template and adapting it to realize the
                client's vision
                through careful HTML, CSS, and JavaScript editing.</p>

            <h3 class="text-uppercase">Project Background</h3>

            <h4>Client's Request</h4>
            <p>The client initially requested a front-end redesign for their website, with a primary emphasis on
                enhancing
                performance and SEO, in addition to achieving improved responsiveness.</p>

            <h4>Design Concept</h4>
            <p>To meet this request, I began by creating a design concept using Figma. Explore the detailed, minimal
                design of
                the PlitoX home page in the <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/YxddxrxXuAypOAwYLNBQ61/PlitoX-version-2?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=nRX3ipjoXCktxsLR-1">Figma design file</a>. The
                client
                approved this concept, paving the way for the next stages of the project.</p>

            <h4>HTML Template</h4>
            <p>Subsequently, the client provided an HTML template that came pre-built with multiple pages, which could
                be
                customized through HTML/CSS/JavaScript editing for the desired redesign.</p>

            <h4>Content Migration</h4>
            <p>Besides the redesign, our focus was on migrating content from the old website to the new one. The primary
                objective was to visually showcase the client's products and services offered on the original site.</p>

            <h3 class="text-uppercase">The Design Process</h3>

            <h4>Research</h4>
            <p>In the research phase, we dedicated extensive efforts to grasp the client's distinctive style and brand,
                a
                pivotal aspect of the project. The client's vision emphasized a high-tech and professional appearance
                for the
                site.</p>

            <h4>Collaboration</h4>
            <p>A collaborative approach was adopted, fostering open communication with the client. Their feedback and
                insights
                played an integral role in shaping the final design.</p>

            <h4>Presentation</h4>
            <p>After completing the design, collaborative sessions were conducted with the client. The goal was not only
                to
                meet their requirements but also to co-create a vision that exceeded their expectations.</p>

            <h3 class="text-uppercase">Implementation</h3>
            

            <h4>Code Review</h4>
            <p>Implementing the project involved reading through the code of the template to identify and manipulate
                prebuilt
                classes, CSS, and HTML elements to create a custom design that aligned with the client's vision.</p>

            <h4>Custom Code and Components</h4>
            <p>The development of custom code and components was essential, incorporating new features and elements to
                meet
                the client's specific requirements.</p>

            <h4>Responsive Design</h4>
            <p>Bootstrap played a pivotal role in achieving a responsive design that looked and functioned seamlessly on
                various
                screen sizes and devices. Additionally, the use of SVGs contributed to improved responsiveness,
                performance, and
                faster load times due to their smaller file size, enhancing the overall user experience.</p>

            <h3 class="text-uppercase">Challenges and Bug Fixing</h3>
            <p>Creating custom components presented challenges when working with prebuilt HTML code. These challenges
                often
                required bug fixing to maintain functionality and design integrity. The process demanded a comprehensive
                understanding of the code, which I successfully achieved through meticulous code reviews and thorough
                examination of the template's documentation.</p>

            <h3 class="text-uppercase">Outcomes</h3>
            <p>The "PlitoX" project successfully met the client's needs and exceeded expectations. Collaborative efforts ensured
                the project precisely met the client's requirements, while custom code and components were implemented to
                realize their unique vision. Performance and SEO goals were achieved, and a responsive design was delivered.
