        </div>

        <div class="col-md-9">
            <p>Mabel Creatives is a design project that emerged as an exciting journey of transforming a client's vision
                into a visually captivating web solution. This project showcases my design skills and ability to
                translate creative concepts into reality.</p>

            <h3 class="text-uppercase">Project Background</h3>
            <p>The project began without any implementation but with the client's color palette in hand. My initial task
                was to conduct in-depth research on the client to create a design that perfectly aligned with their
                style and brand identity. This research phase was essential in understanding the client's goals and
                objectives.</p>

            <p>The client, an umbrella company, has a vision to create a unified digital presence. This vision includes
                a main site that acts as the central hub, connecting seamlessly to four distinct subsites. Each subsite
                represents a unique company under the umbrella, offering specialized services. The challenge was to
                design a cohesive web solution that harmonizes these diverse entities while maintaining their individual
                identities.</p>

            <p>This ambitious undertaking required in-depth planning, strategic design, and an unwavering commitment to
                delivering a web solution that seamlessly integrates the main site with the four subsites.</p>

            <h3 class="text-uppercase">The Design Process</h3>
            <p>During the design phase, I utilized Figma to create a comprehensive visual representation of the project.
            You can explore the detailed design in the Figma design file to get a closer look at the creative
            concepts and layout elements. <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/cF4vNUjU2FAasYeFWjEk0K/Mabel?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=qLCksySYdCg9xGEj-1" target="_blank">Explore the Figma design file</a>.</p>
                

            <h4>Research:</h4>
            <p>Extensive research was a foundational step in which I delved into the essence of the client's unique
                style and brand. This in-depth exploration played a pivotal role in crafting a design that authentically
                resonated with the client's goals and brand identity.</p>

            <h4>Collaboration:</h4>
            <p>I strongly believe in the power of co-design, where developers and clients work hand in hand to create
                exceptional web solutions. Throughout the project, I maintained open communication with the client,
                fostering a collaborative atmosphere. Their feedback and insights were not just welcomed but actively
                encouraged, as they played a crucial role in shaping the final design.</p>

            <p>This collaborative approach ensures that the web solution isn't developed in isolation but is a result of
                a shared vision. It allows for real-time adjustments and improvements, leading to a design that aligns
                perfectly with the client's style and brand identity.</p>

            <h4>Presentation:</h4>
            <p>After completing the design, I believe in the value of sitting down with the client to hear their ideas,
                feedback, and aspirations. The goal extends beyond just meeting their requirements; it's about
                co-creating a vision that exceeds their expectations.</p>

            <p>Through collaborative sessions and brainstorming, we harness the power of the design file to visualize
                those ideas. It's much easier to form a completed vision when you have something tangible to look at,
                and this is where the design file plays a pivotal role. It becomes a canvas for creativity, a foundation
                for discussion, and a catalyst for turning ideas into reality.</p>

            <h3 class="text-uppercase">Implementation</h3>
            <p>I didn't stop at design. I also implemented the website on WordPress, bringing the design to life. One of
                the pivotal considerations during the implementation was ensuring responsiveness. Given the client's
                substantial presence on Instagram, where users predominantly engage on mobile devices, it was evident
                that mobile-friendliness was a key factor.</p>

            <p>The website was meticulously designed and developed to provide an optimal user experience across a
                variety of devices, with a particular focus on mobile usability. This approach ensures that visitors can
                seamlessly access the website and its connected subsites, regardless of the device they use. <a href="https://mabelcreatives.com">You can
                    explore the live website here</a>.</p>

            <h3 class="text-uppercase">Outcomes</h3>
            <p>The project culminated in a design that left the client thoroughly impressed. It's a testament to my
                ability to transform a vision into a visually captivating web solution that aligns perfectly with the
                client's style and brand identity.
